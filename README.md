# [ANT TRACKER 1.0] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [TRAAASH]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [THEERTHA SB] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING CHENGANOOR]
- Member 1: [THEERTHA S B] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING CHENGANOOR]
- Member 2: [SARAH BASIL] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING CHENGANOOR]

### Project Description
A real-time tracking system for ants.
Uses webcam to follow a single ant's epic journey.
Ants work hard. 
Someone should notice.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Ants are among the most ecologically significant insects, playing crucial roles in soil aeration, seed dispersion, and as bioindicators. However, understanding their collective behavior, navigation patterns, and foraging routes is extremely difficult due to their small size and unpredictable movements<img width="7157" height="115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e84d633d-9ffb-44e4-8ae6-9a47c5f27547" />
]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We propose an Automated Ant Tracking System using computer vision and AI techniques to monitor and analyze ant movements in real-time.
System Features:
High-resolution video capture of ant colonies.
Real-time tracking and path analysis.
